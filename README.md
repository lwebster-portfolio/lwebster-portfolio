**Finance & Analytics Professional | Controller | Applied Machine Learning**

I build financial models, automation systems, and predictive analytics tools for complex, multi-entity financial operations. My work sits at the intersection of accounting, data engineering, and applied statistics — solving real business problems with defensible methodology.

## What I Build

**Financial Modeling & Simulation**
Monte Carlo engines for covenant risk analysis, CECL expected credit loss models, multi-entity consolidation frameworks, and rent-vs-buy decision tools with stochastic inputs.

**Collections & Receivables Analytics**
XGBoost-based scoring models for debt recovery optimization — feature engineering on payment behavior, vintage segmentation, and probability-of-default estimation across portfolio tranches.

**Accounting Automation**
End-to-end process automation for remittance reconciliation, bank allocation, daily posting workflows, and trust account compliance monitoring. Designed to eliminate manual touchpoints in high-volume environments.
